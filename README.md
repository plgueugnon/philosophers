### Overview
- create a software that simulates Dijkstra's dining philosophers problem
- learn the concepts of concurrent and parallel execution between threads
- manipulates threads and mutex
- leaks, deadlocks, datarace or thread starvation are stricly forbidden

### Problem specifications
- One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
  There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
- The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
  - While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
   - while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
   - and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
- There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
- Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
- When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.
- Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
- Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
- Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
- No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!


### Warning
As this project manipulates threads and mutex this project might not work well or even not work work at all depending on the OS you use.
